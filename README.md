## Step 0: Data analysis

First step was to download the data, look at the paper, prepare the data


## Step 1: Random model

Let's see how a random oracle fares

## Step 2: Geometric model

Using bloom filters, very very fast
Clean data with set intersection

Accuracy without projections: 40%
Accuracy with projections: 60%

## Step 3: Tensorflow model

Following a tutorial 

Cleaning data very expensive

Accuracy without projections: 50%
Accuracy with projections: 69.97%

## Step 4: Probabilistic Projections

Correlation matrix, PCA
Greatly improve the accuracy

## Step 5: Google scholar

Reverse search on google scholar
